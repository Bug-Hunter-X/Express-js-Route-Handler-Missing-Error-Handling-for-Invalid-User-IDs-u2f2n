# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User IDs

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: missing error handling for invalid input. Specifically, the `/users/:id` route attempts to parse the `id` parameter as an integer without any error handling. If the `id` parameter is not a valid integer, the application will either return an error or unexpectedly behave differently, potentially revealing sensitive information or causing a crash.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code. It attempts to find a user based on the provided ID.  However, there's no check to ensure the `id` parameter is a valid integer before parsing.  This leads to issues if a non-numeric string is passed as the ID.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates a solution to this problem. The improved code includes checks for invalid input and appropriate error handling to prevent unexpected behavior.
